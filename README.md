- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jawsh-me.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in almost everything tech-related, though I'm particularly interested in PowerShell
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C#, which I initially picked up learing to assist with my PowerShell skills, but after learning more, I'm looking to do a deeper dive into "real" programming.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: github@jawsh.me (Though I likely won't reply from this address)
