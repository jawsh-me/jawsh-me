- 👋 Hi, I’m @jawsh-me.
- 👀 I’m interested in almost everything tech-related, though I'm particularly interested in PowerShell, which I use in my dayjob as a psuedo-Sysadmin/Helpdesk Escalation Admin. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, which I initially picked up learing to assist with my PowerShell skills, but after learning more, I'm looking to do a deeper dive into "real" programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that helps me learn and grow. While I do have experience with the Open-Source community, my dayjob is currently in a Windows environment, so that's where much of my focus lies currently.
- 📫 How to reach me: github@jawsh.me (Though I likely won't reply from this address)
